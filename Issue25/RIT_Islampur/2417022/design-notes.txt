Effervescence 2025 – Text Logo Design Notes
Theme: Rangara – Ek Sunehra Karwaan

This logo is designed as a bold, expressive text-based identity for
Effervescence 2025, inspired by vintage Indian cinema, hand-painted
Bollywood posters, and the festive spirit of cultural storytelling.

The typography uses thick, brush-stroke lettering to convey energy,
movement, and celebration. The slightly uneven, hand-painted texture
adds a human and artistic feel, reflecting the journey (“Karwaan”)
and creative vibrance of the fest.

A warm color palette of deep crimson red, antique gold, and midnight
blue has been chosen to symbolize passion, heritage, and elegance.
Gold accents enhance the festive and premium appeal of the logo.

Visual elements such as film reels, gears, stars, and ornamental
flourishes represent cinema, creativity, teamwork, and the smooth
functioning of a cultural festival at scale. The dripping paint
effect adds a raw, artistic edge, reinforcing the idea of live
expression and artistic freedom.

The banner text “Rangara: Ek Sunehra Karwaan” is placed prominently
to anchor the theme and provide cultural context, making the logo
suitable for both digital and print usage.

Overall, the logo balances tradition with modern digital aesthetics,
making it adaptable across posters, social media, merchandise,
and stage backdrops while staying true to the spirit of Effervescence.
